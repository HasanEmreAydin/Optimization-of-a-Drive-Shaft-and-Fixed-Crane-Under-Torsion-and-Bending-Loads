# Optimization-of-a-Drive-Shaft-and-Fixed-Crane-Under-Torsion-and-Bending-Loads


This project analyzes and optimizes a drive shaft and a fixed crane under mechanical loads. The drive shaft's shear stress, torsion angle, and deformation were calculated analytically and validated through ANSYS simulations. Alternative materials such as HM-epoxy and EG-polyester were tested for weight reduction while maintaining structural integrity. For the fixed crane, stress distribution was analyzed under a 10,000 kg load, leading to optimized base height, wall thickness, and additional support structures. ANSYS simulations were used to refine the design by reducing material usage while ensuring structural stability.
